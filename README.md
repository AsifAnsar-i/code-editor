![Screenshot 2024-06-28 160233](https://github.com/AsifAnsar-i/code-editor/assets/91591849/9b9da8dd-2b16-49c9-b6ec-b90b50d981ef)

This project is a simple code editor built using React. It leverages PrismJS for syntax highlighting and provides a basic interface for writing and viewing code with real-time syntax highlighting.

Features
Real-time syntax highlighting using PrismJS
Basic code editor functionality with a textarea element
Synchronized scrolling between the textarea and highlighted code
Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
PrismJS: Lightweight library for syntax highlighting
prism-react-renderer: React implementation of PrismJS for rendering syntax-highlighted code
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn
Installation
Clone the repository:

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to see the code editor in action.

Usage
Type your code in the textarea on the page.
The code will be syntax-highlighted in real-time.
The textarea and the highlighted code will scroll together to keep the view synchronized.
Code Structure
src/App.js: Main application component that renders the CodeEditor component.
src/CodeEditor.js: Component that implements the code editor with syntax highlighting.
src/App.css: Basic styling for the application.
Customization
You can customize the appearance and behavior of the code editor by modifying the styles and configuration in CodeEditor.js and App.css.

Known Issues
Cursor misalignment can occur if the textarea and pre element styles are not perfectly synchronized.
Ensure that the fonts, padding, margin, and line height are identical for both elements.
